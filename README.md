### Overview

Create Rock Paper Scissors game. this will be an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of web development repertoire)!

### Instructions

* Create a game that suits this user story:

  * Only two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

  * Deploy assignment to Github Pages.
